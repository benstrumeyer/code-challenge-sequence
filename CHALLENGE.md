# Frame Sequence Playback Code Challenge

Inspiration for this challenge came from the hero animation on the [Mac Studio](https://www.apple.com/mac-studio/) landing page.

You are challenged to implement an animation from a sequence of image files derived from a [video](../../blob/main/src/public/media/countdown.mp4). The sequence must play through in order from frames 1 through 100.

1. You may use JavaScript or TypeScript.
1. You may use CSS or SCSS.
1. You may use any libraries, frameworks, or utilities you prefer.
1. You are only required to support modern browsers.

Good luck!

## Challenge Steps

1. Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.
1. Create the responsive layout shown in this [design](https://www.sketch.com/s/c3e57c08-91c3-47fd-9009-5d8ce2fc2f03), including the image in the **hero section**.
1. Create the **animation** from the images in the [src/public/img/countdown/](../../tree/main/src/public/img/countdown/) folder.
1. Replace the image in the **hero section** with the **animation**.
1. Make the **animation** play through when the page loads.
1. Make the "Jump to cards" **button** take the user to the **cards section**.
1. Tag us in a pull request when you are ready to review.

### Extra credit

1. Make the **hero section** stay pinned for 4 full scrolls. (see [viewport units](https://caniuse.com/viewport-units), [position sticky](https://caniuse.com/css-sticky))
1. Pair the animation playback to the scroll position, so the user sees frame 1 at the top of the page, and frame 100 when the **cards section** comes into view.
